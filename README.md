# BCDLpurple
BCDLpurple is a responsive, flexible and user-friendly theme for WordPress based on `underscores` and `Bootstrap 5`. 
Although it is functional, the theme is still under development, and will be continually updated.

Installation
---------------

### Requirements

`BCDLpurple` requires the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Quick Start

Clone or download this repository, change its name to something else (like, say, `something-you-like`), and then you'll need to do a six-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.

1. Search for `'bcdlpurple'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain and replace with: `'something-you-like'`.
2. Search for `_bcdlpurple_` to capture all the functions names and replace with: `something_you_like`.
3. Search for `Text Domain: bcdlpurple` in `style.css` and replace with: `Text Domain: something-you-like`.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;bcdlpurple</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Something_you_Like</code>.
5. Search for `bcdl-` to capture prefixed handles and replace with: `something-you-like-`.
6. Search for `_BCDL_` (in uppercase) to capture constants and replace with: `SOMETHING_YOU_LIKE_`.

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css`, the links in `footer.php` with your own information and rename `bcdlpurple.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug. Next, update or delete this readme.
